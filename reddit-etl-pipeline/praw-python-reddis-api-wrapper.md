# PRAW - python reddis api wrapper

PRAW or Python Reddit API Wrapper [1][3] is a Python package that simplifies accessing Reddit's API. Its aim is to be easy to use and follows all of Reddit's API rules. It can be installed via pip and is supported on Python 3.7+. Once installed, users can interact with Reddit using the package. With PRAW, users can access a subreddit, submission, or Redditor [1].

Some of the use cases for PRAW include data collection, analysis, and automation. For instance, a user can use the package to extract information from Reddit, such as upvotes and downvotes, comments, and posts. The extracted data can be used to gain insights, analyze trends, or train machine learning models. Furthermore, PRAW can be used to automate tasks, like posting comments, upvoting or downvoting posts, or even creating a bot that performs various tasks on Reddit [2].
