# Main Airflow DAG
https://github.com/andrem8/surf_dash/blob/main/dags/surf_dag/main.py

* Python script named `main.py` is part of an Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for the Surfline Dashboard project.
* Whole code is defined in this one python file.
* This script is designed to orchestrate a series of tasks that collect data from the Surfline API, export it to an AWS S3 bucket, and then ingest it into a Postgres data warehouse for visualization and analysis.

Here's a summary of the tasks performed by the script:

1. **download_data:** This function collects data from the Surfline API for a specific spotId and a specified number of days and interval hours. The data is then saved as a CSV file.

2. **load_s3_data:** This function uploads the CSV file created in the `download_data` function to an AWS S3 bucket.

3. **download_s3_data:** This function downloads the most recently added file from the S3 bucket and saves it locally.

4. **load_data:** This function establishes a connection to a local Postgres database and ingests the data from the downloaded CSV file. It creates a temporary table, inserts the data into this table, and then inserts the unique rows into the main data table.

The script uses the `boto3` library to interact with AWS S3, the `psycopg2` library to interact with the Postgres database, and the `pysurfline` library to interact with the Surfline API.

The tasks are orchestrated using Airflow, with the `default_args` dictionary specifying the default arguments for the DAG, and the `ingestion_dag` object representing the DAG itself. The specific order and dependencies of the tasks within the DAG are not visible in the provided excerpt of the script.
