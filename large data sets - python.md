# Processing of large datasets in Python

Some Python libraries and tools that can be use to process large datasets locally on a single Linux instance:

1. **Pandas**: Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation library. It provides data structures for efficiently storing large datasets and tools for data wrangling and analysis.

2. **Dask**: Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python that's often used in analytics where it can scale from single-machine to cluster-based computations. It integrates well with the Python ecosystem and can work directly with datasets stored in formats like CSV, HDF5, and Apache Parquet.

3. **NumPy**: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

4. **Vaex**: Vaex is a high performance Python library for lazy, out-of-core DataFrames (similar to Pandas), to visualize and explore big tabular datasets. It can calculate statistics such as mean, sum, count, standard deviation etc, on an N-dimensional grid up to a billion (10^9) objects/rows per second.

5. **Modin**: Modin is a library that accelerates Pandas by changing a single line of code in your notebook or script. It uses Ray or Dask to provide an effortless way to speed up your pandas notebooks, scripts, and libraries.

6. **PySpark**: PySpark is the Python library for Apache Spark, an open-source, distributed computing system that provides APIs for big data processing and analysis. PySpark offers PySpark SQL for structured data and DataFrame, MLlib for machine learning algorithms, and GraphFrames for graph computation.

7. **Ray**: Ray is a high-performance distributed execution framework targeted at large-scale machine learning and reinforcement learning applications. It includes a powerful API for parallel and distributed computing.

8. **CuPy**: CuPy is an open-source matrix library accelerated with NVIDIA CUDA. It provides GPU accelerated computing with Python and can be used as a drop-in replacement for NumPy.

9. **Blaze**: Blaze provides a standard API for doing computations with various in-memory and on-disk backends: NumPy, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, MongoDB, PyTables, PySpark.

10. **Bottleneck**: Bottleneck is a collection of fast, NaN-aware NumPy array functions written in C. In the absence of NaNs, bottleneck and numpy functions should produce the exact same output.

Remember, the choice of a tool or library depends on the specific requirements of your project, such as the size and type of your data, the processing power you have available, and the specific tasks you need to perform.
